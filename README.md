Eyes moving with cursor

Fun with HTML, CSS and JavaScript - the software has two synchronized eyes that will follow the mouse pointer. Eye and ball shape can be adjusted in the css file, as can color. 


At this time the code serves its function as an educational tool - allowing users to experience working with with HTML and CSS. Future improvements could include a button to change eye color, or a random function to have the eyes go crazy every now and then.

To run this software - download the files and save them into a folder. Using Visual Studio Code, or your preferred local web server, run index.html to see the program in action. Move your mouse and see the eyes move.
